## Supplementary Material for "Human Pose Estimation for Expressive Movement Descriptors in Vocal Music Performances"

## Abstract

Vocal concerts in Indian music are invariably associated with the
  performers’ hand gesticulations that are believed to convey emotion,
  music semantics as well as the individual style of the
  performers. Video recordings, with one or more cameras, along with
  markerless human pose estimation algorithms can be employed to
  capture such movements, and thus potentially solve music information
  retrieval (MIR) queries.  Nevertheless, off-the-shelf algorithms are
  built for the most part for upright human configurations contrasting
  with seated positions in Indian vocal concerts and the upper body
  movements in the context of performing music.  Current
  state-of-the-art algorithms are black box neural network based and
  this calls for an investigation of the components of such
  algorithms.  Key decisions involve the choice of one or more
  cameras, the choice of 2D or 3D features, and relevant parameters
  such as confidence thresholds in common machine learning methods.
  In this paper, we quantify the increase in the performance with 3
  cameras on two music information retrieval tasks. We offer insights
  for single and multi-view processing of videos.
